This code script works to scan content that has the same value in different files recursively. The following are the steps to run this code

## Requirements
- Ruby installed

## Setup
- Pull this repo to your local machine
- Navigate to this repo folder path
- Once inside the folder path, run: ```ruby main.rb "the path of the folder you want to scan"```
\nexample: ```ruby main.rb "/Users/ahsan/Documents/ahsan data/DropsuiteTest"```
- See the result
