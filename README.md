This code script works to scan content that has the same value in different files recursively. 

## Requirement
- Ruby installed

## Setup
- Pull this repo to your local machine
- Navigate to this repo folder path
- Once inside the folder path, run: ```ruby main.rb "/the/path/of/the/folder/you/want/to/scan"```
  - You can use the folder in 'Sample Folder' on this project as a sample for testing
  - Copy or move 'DropsuiteTest' to anywhere path you want
  - example: 
    - ```ruby main.rb "/Users/ahsan/Documents/ahsan data/DropsuiteTest"```
    - ```ruby main.rb '/Users/ahsan/Downloads/DropsuiteTest'```
    - ```ruby main.rb /Users/ahsan/Desktop/DropsuiteTest```
- See the result

Thanks
